# Raisin Type Prediction Flask App

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application that predicts the type of raisin based on specific input features. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms, and the application provides an easy-to-use web interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple HTML form for inputting raisin features.
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to classify raisins as either Kecimen or Besni.
- **API Integration**: Exposes a RESTful API endpoint for making predictions.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant feedback on raisin types based on user input.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (for model training and predictions)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (for the user interface)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
